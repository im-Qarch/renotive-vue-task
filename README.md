```

Then run a clean-install and build the project:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

```

Now you should see a `/dir` directory in project's root. This directory contains all the files required to deploy and run this project. See [Deploy](#deploy) for more details on how to deploy it on a server.

## Deploy

Qarch is a static powered SPA (single-page application) which can be hosted like any other static sites. just put the `/dist` directory on your web server and open it on your browser.

However there is one extra configuration needed to be adjusted. since we're going to deploy a SPA, web server must redirects all routes (including routes that may result in `404`) to the `/dist/index.html` and let it to handle routing from client-side.
